# Automatic-Helmet-Detection-and-Number-Plate-Recognition

So, I have implemented Automatic Helmet Detection and Number Plate Recognition in Python using YOLOv3 and some other Computer Vision techniques.

Our main motive behind AUtomatic Helmet Detection and Number Plate Recognition were to first detect if someone is wearing a helmet or not, if he is wearing it, no problem, but if not, detect his number plate and send an e-challan to him.

I have implemented this project by using two approach.

Approach 1 - YOLO (You Only Look Once) Deep Learning Technique.

Approach 2 - CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) Deep Learning Technique.
